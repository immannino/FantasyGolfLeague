# FantasyGolfLeague

It was all a dream.

Not really, we just had an excel sheet and some free time. Now making this little side project a website.

Weekly, pain free, fantasy golf. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Create a fantasy board, invite your friends, wager offline bets, and more.

Notes:
    - Child routing issues, when developing locally, in the index.html change the base href to "/" instead of "./". Change back to "./" when deploying.
